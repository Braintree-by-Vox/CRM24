# Service Cases and Activities
The Customer Service module provides functions to service a customer. Here are some useful definitions

- A **case** is the central record that identifies an incident that a customer has logged.
- **Activities** are the means by which we communicate with a customer. For example 
  - we make a phone call to a customer (outgoing activity).
  - a customer calls a customer representative for some issue (incoming activity)
    >These type of activities are normally the origin for a the generation of a case. 
- **Routing rules** can be set up, to route a specific incident (case) to a queue, a team, or a user to handle that case.
A **queue** can be seen as a bucket where we assign some of the cases, so that the users who belongs to that queue will take action on that case record or incident record

- **Holiday schedules** are the timelines by which we define the days of the year that represent a holiday for our business, including public holidays and shut-down periods. These can then be used to ensure that cases which are subject to an SLA are handled on the business operating times and days only.

- A **Service Level Agreement** (SLA) is used to provide a facility to the customer to solve issues within a specified, contracutal time limit.  

- **Entitlements** are the level of services that the business will provide to the customer e.g. granting the customer a 24/7 service for a product that we have sold 

- **Scheduling** is extending or deciding a timeline at a customer's place for servicing or installation or maintenance activities.

All activities need to be marked as Complete before the case can be marked as resolved.

If the action is taken to Resolve Case and there is an open activity then the case is prevented from being resolved, unless you are willing for those activities to be auto cancelled.

The activities can be actioned from the Timeline.

They can either be:
- Assigned
- Closed
- Added to a Queue
- Record Opened
- Deleted
Once opened, the activity can be marked as Complete.

### Assignment
A case can be assigned to a user or a team.

### Adding to Queue
A case can also be assigned to a queue, and then from there a user can access the queue

  ![alt text](image-52.png)

If a queue does not exist it can be created.

Once the case is assigned to a queue, a user who belongs to that queue can select the case and choose **Pick**. This assigns the case to the user to work on.

### Resolve Case
When all case activity is complete, click on “Resolve” in the top command bar. The case is read-only when resolved / finalised.

If a case needs to be reactivated after it has been resolved, for example an additional note needs to be added, then the case can be reactivated. The additional activity can be added, and then the case must be resolved again.

Once the case is resolved, the case can be seen from the List: My Resolved Cases
