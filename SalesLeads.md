# [Sales Leads, Opportunities and Activities](SalesLeads)
A **Lead** is potential business, the first stage of sales process. 
When you have a lead, there is a requirement to follow up on the lead to gauge whether the prospective customer is still interested. 
From the **Lead** stage, we can convert the lead to a opportunity by **qualifying** the lead. We can also disqualify the lead if the prospective customer no longer wants to purchase the product. If the lead is disqualified then the sales process is stopped there.

If the lead is **qualified**, a contact record and an account record are created automatically. 
In the typical sales process lifecycle there are two types of entities involved in the sales process:
- Account:  a company or an organization from which we get business. 
- Contact: an individual from which we get business

There are two ways two ways that we can create customers in CRM24. 
- from the lead qualification process, which will automatically create contact and account
- manually creating the contact and if we very sure that there is no requirement of leads, we can directly create customers. 

The lead can be an individual, or an organization, or an individual who is part of an  organisation. In other words, there is a relationship between a contact and account. Other connections can also be created, for example between two different customers.

A lead is always generated from a marketing campaign. We distribute  promotional offers to customers, and generae leads from this. Once the leads are captured, we qualify and disqualify the lead 

We are also able to associate an account with a parent account so that there will be an organization hierarchy and we can associate corresponding records like opportunities, orders and invoices

At the stage of **opportunity**, we can identify who the stakeholders of this opportunity are, who the competition may be, and who our the sales team is.
We then add the products that the customer is interested in and the associated price list. 

After creating the opportunity, we provide a quotation to the customer for the products and services they require. This quote can be emailed to the customer.

If the quotation is accepted by the customer, we move to the **order** stage. 
When the order has been fulfilled, an invoice is created and an invoice document will be sent to the customer for payment.
