### Filtering and Searching

**Global Search:**  The global search is very useful to search across various entities i.e. Clients, Contacts, Leads etc

![alt text](image-18.png)

![alt text](image-19.png)

**Advanced Find:** allows you to build personal views. You could start with a default view and then save it with a new name, and thereafter edit the columns and properties and filters used.

![alt text](image-20.png)

![alt text](image-21.png)

These Personal Views can be used for ad hoc reporting, for instance to export some lists to Excel.

![alt text](image-22.png)

The Advanced Filter can be used to restrict the list based on certain applied column filters.

After clicking on the Advanced Filter:

![alt text](image-23.png)

Various fields can then be used to apply filters to the list

Another way of applying a column filter is to click on the column and choose to Filter By

### Timeline
With your timeline, you can create your different activities, your notes with attachments and other posts. You do have a nice filtering capability. So within the timeline you could filter by record type like the different activity types. If you wanted to just look at the emails or just look at the tasks or phone calls, do that right within here within the record.

### Personalisations
Using the Gear in the top right of the window, you can access Personalisation Settings

![alt text](image-27.png)

This is where you can set certain settings that are relative to your login only i.e. No of records to display on a page (useful when needing to export records to Excel), or an email signature e.t.c
