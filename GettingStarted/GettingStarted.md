### Filtering and Searching

**Global Search:**  The global search is very useful to search across various entities i.e. Clients, Contacts, Leads etc

![alt text](image-18.png)

![alt text](image-19.png)

**Advanced Find:** allows you to build personal views. You could start with a default view and then save it with a new name, and thereafter edit the columns and properties and filters used.

![alt text](image-20.png)

![alt text](image-21.png)

These Personal Views can be used for ad hoc reporting, for instance to export some lists to Excel.

![alt text](image-22.png)

The Advanced Filter can be used to restrict the list based on certain applied column filters.

After clicking on the Advanced Filter:
